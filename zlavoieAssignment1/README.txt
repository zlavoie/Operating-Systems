I downloaded iostat package to be able to more easily access info such as CPU time spent executing in user mode, system mode, and idle.

There are 3 sub-directories in the main directory (PartB, PartC, PartD). These sub directories contain the program that just prints out the added (extended) content for that part of the program.

***IF YOU RUN "observer" EXECUTABLE IN THE MAIN DIRECTORY THEN IT WILL RUN ALL THREE PARTS (B,C,D) TOGETHER IN ONE PROGRAM***

If you run it all as one program, if you do not put extra commands in the command line (such as in PartD, you would have to do something like observer -s 2 60 to have part D of the program run. If you do not put the extra commands needed, then only parts B and C will run, part D will not execute.

Included in this zip is also my answers for part A as a text file, called SOLUTIONS.txt

a run of all the sections would be (in the command line):
/student/cs314/zlavoieAssignment1/observer -s 2 60
